# Scientific Validation Log

Record meaningful reference comparisons and discrepancies here or link to machine-readable validation artifacts.

Each record should identify:
- date and code revision;
- capability under test;
- project configuration;
- reference source/tool and its configuration/version;
- expected/reference result;
- project result;
- absolute/relative error where meaningful;
- discrepancy classification;
- accepted/rejected/unresolved status;
- linked scientific assumption/ADR/Proof record.

Initially GMAT is the primary orbital reference. Add independent authoritative validation sources as the project matures.

## VAL-0001 — Kepler oracle against textbook worked examples
- **Date / revision:** 2026-10-05 / `759fa23`
- **Capability:** `tars.astro.kepler.propagate`, `tars.astro.elements.rv_to_elements` (the M1 validation oracle)
- **References:**
  - Vallado (2013) Example 2-4: Kepler problem, 40 min.
  - Vallado (2013) Example 2-5: RV2COE.
  - SciPy `solve_ivp` DOP853 (rtol 1e-13) as an independent numerical reference.
- **Result:**
  - Example 2-4 matches every printed digit: 1e-4 km in position, 1e-6 km/s in velocity.
  - Example 2-5 matches at printed precision.
  - DOP853 agrees within 1 mm and 1 µm/s for circular, e = 0.15 and e = 0.72 cases.
- **Discrepancy:** A Curtis (2014) Example 3.7 velocity component recalled from memory differed in the 3rd significant figure, while position matched. The value was a transcription from memory and could not be verified, so it is **not used** as an oracle. Classification: reference transcription uncertainty. Status: unresolved and non-blocking. Verify against the physical book if desired.
- **Linked:** `tests/test_kepler.py`, `tests/test_elements.py`; ADR-0006

## VAL-0002 — M1 RK4 convergence and invariants against the exact two-body solution
- **Date / revision:** 2026-10-05 / `6800d8b`
- **Configuration:** `scenarios/m1_leo_250km.json` (dt varied 60…1 s), 53 700 s
- **Reference:** analytic Kepler propagation (VAL-0001)
- **Result:**
  - At dt = 10 s: 0.298 m position error, \|ΔE/E\| = 3.8e-10.
  - Fitted order 4.33; full table in DR-0008.
- **Discrepancy:** order 4.33 rather than 4. Classification: numerical, pre-asymptotic. Status: accepted pending DR-0008.
- **Linked:** DR-0004, DR-0008, `toolbox/validators/m1_proof.py`

## VAL-0003 — Cross-platform agreement (DR-0006)
- **Date / revision:** 2026-10-05 / CI run 37397754454
- **Platforms:**
  - macOS 26 x86_64 (local)
  - ubuntu-latest x86_64
  - macos-latest arm64

  All use Python 3.12 and NumPy 2.5.3 from `uv.lock`.
- **Result:**
  - Event-log sha256 differs between platforms.
  - Final-state difference ≤ 2.9e-6 m and ≤ 3.4e-9 m/s after 10 orbits.
  - Repeat runs on the same platform are byte-identical.
- **Classification:** numerical (floating-point, platform-dependent rounding). Status: expected; bound proposed in DR-0008.
